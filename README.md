<h1>VLAN Network Plan</h1>
I just started to check and work with network systems. For me, the Cisco Packet Tracer is a good way to understand of the network systems. 
It is like a simulation of real network systems. 
Also, In this project I desided to do VLAN network for learning. 
I didn't write IP calculating for subnetting but you can check and find it on the internet.

-I planned to use 3 network areas for this project.<br>
-I selected " 192.168.1.0 " adress. You can change as you wish.<br>
-IP addresses are like that:<br>

<h3>First part of the network(VLAN 10)</h3>
192.168.1.0 /Network Address<br>
192.168.1.1 /Default Gateway Address<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
192.168.1.63 /Broadcast Address <br>
<h3>Second part of the network(VLAN 20)</h3>
192.168.1.64 /Network Address<br>
192.168.1.65 /Default Gateway Address<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
192.168.1.127 /Broadcast Address <br>     
<h3>Third part of the network(VLAN 30)</h3>
192.168.1.128 /Network Address<br>
192.168.1.129 /Default Gateway Address<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
192.168.1.191 /Broadcast Address <br>
